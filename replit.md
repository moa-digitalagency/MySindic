# MySindic - Projet Replit

## Overview

**MySindic** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for condominium management in the Moroccan market. It provides a comprehensive solution for syndics (superadmins) and residents, aiming to modernize property management, offer a mobile-first and responsive experience, automate administrative tasks like fund calls and charge distribution, and facilitate communication between all stakeholders.

## User Preferences

- **Workflow:** Iterative development is preferred.
- **Documentation:** The `PROJECT_TRACKING.md` file must always be read and updated before and after any major modification. This file is the reference document for project tracking. Mark tasks as completed once done and add new tasks identified during development.
- **Coding Style:** All comments and documentation should be in French.
- **Communication:** Provide clear and detailed explanations.
- **Interaction:** Ask for confirmation before making significant architectural changes or adding new external dependencies.

## System Architecture

MySindic is built as a PWA with a Python Flask backend and an HTML/CSS frontend utilizing Tailwind CSS. PostgreSQL is used for the database, integrated via Replit Database.

### UI/UX Decisions

- **Design Approach:** Mobile-first and responsive design using Tailwind CSS for a modern aesthetic.
- **Icons:** Feather Icons are used for modern iconography.
- **Frontend Framework:** Vanilla JavaScript for client-side interactions.
- **PWA Features (Future):** Service Worker, manifest, and offline mode are planned for a native-like mobile experience.

### Technical Implementations

- **Backend:** Flask serves as the web framework, with SQLAlchemy as the ORM for database interactions. Flask-Migrate handles database migrations, Flask-Login manages user sessions, and Flask-CORS provides CORS support. PyJWT is used for authentication tokens. Gunicorn is the WSGI server for production.
- **Data Models:** The application features 16 core data models covering users, residences, financial management (charges, payments), maintenance, communication (news, polls), documents, general assemblies, and litigation.
- **Business Services:**
    - **ChargeCalculator:** Automatically calculates charge distribution based on tanti√®mes, lot balances, unpaid charges, and payment tracking.
    - **NotificationService:** Centralized service for sending email notifications for maintenance requests, fund calls, and general assemblies.
- **API Structure:**
    - **Admin Routes (`/api/admin/*`):** Comprehensive CRUD operations and dashboards for superadmins, covering residences, units, charges, payments, news, maintenance, general assemblies, litigation, polls, and user management.
    - **Resident Routes (`/api/resident/*`):** Secure, personalized dashboards for residents to view news, create and track maintenance requests, manage finances, participate in polls and general assemblies, and access documents and maintenance logs.

### System Design Choices

- **Database:** PostgreSQL was chosen for its native Replit integration, ACID transaction support, scalability, and ability to handle complex relationships.
- **Backend Framework:** Flask was selected for its lightweight, flexible nature, suitability for REST APIs, and rich ecosystem.
- **Modularity:** Flask Blueprints are used to organize routes, ensuring clear separation of concerns (auth, admin, resident) and promoting modular, maintainable code.
- **Shared Services:** Business logic is encapsulated in shared services (e.g., `ChargeCalculator`, `NotificationService`) for reusability, testability, and clear separation of concerns.
- **Security:**
    - Password hashing with Werkzeug.
    - Secure sessions with Flask-Login.
    - Authorization decorators (`@login_required`, `@superadmin_required`).
    - All resident endpoints verify `residence_id` to prevent horizontal privilege escalation.
    - Foreign keys are derived from `current_user` to avoid trusting client input.
    - Server-side validation and authorization are enforced on all endpoints.
    - Transactions with rollback on errors are used for database operations.
    - Environment variables are used for secrets (`SESSION_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`).
